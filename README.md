# React + Redux + WP-API v2  Wordpress Theme

Experimental boilerplate inspired by inspired by [Picard](https://github.com/Automattic/Picard) theme,
for this i transform to ES6 syntax and improve the code

## Installation

### 1. Working WordPress installation
First, prepare a proper WordPress environment:

* You will obviously need a working *WordPress* installation,
* You will also need *WP REST API*. It is a plugin (with plans to incorporate into the WordPress core) that creates REST API to be used by the theme. Plugin is currently **NOT** in plugins repository, you have to upload the files manually. Install and activate the [WP REST API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master) plugin (make sure that you are using the `master` branch â€“ the default is currently develop),
* Set your permlink structure to `/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/`.

### 2. Theme building
Unlike other themes, this one uses a build process, you need:

* *node.js* and *npm* - node is an command line JavaScript interpreter that is used for build process. npm stands for node package manager. You can install both from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/download/),
* *[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)* is a build system running on node. Once you install node and npm, type `npm install -g gulp` to install gulp in your system (`-g` flag installs package globally so you will now have gulp command in your command line).

**Next, you have to set up the theme:**

1. Download the theme files to `wp-content/themes` directory of your WordPress installation. You can clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/felipeegasneris/react-redux-wp-api.git`) or just press download on the right side  (remember to unzip).
2. In theme directory, run `npm install` to install the node dependencies. npm will take care of the rest (npm installs dependencies listed in the [package.json](./package.json) file).
3. In theme directory, run `gulp build` to compile the JavaScript and SASS. Gulp will know what to do, because proper actions are listed in the [gulpfile.js](./gulpfile.js),
4. In theme directory, run `gulp watch` to actively develop the theme and have the styles and JS files automatically update. Watch command listens for file changes and starts build process every time you save a source file.
